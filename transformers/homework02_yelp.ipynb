It's one of the only restaurants open before 4pm on a Sunday afternoon downtown and within walking distance from the symphony. Walked in with my mother and aunt and after a few minutes of not being acknowledged, I tried to flag down the server that walked by. \\\"Excuse me, excuse me, EXCUSE ME!\\\". She ignored me and I heard a voice from another female voice from behind tell us that we can seat ourselves. We sat at a booth...it was fairly crowded. \\n\\nWe waited for about 10 minutes when a gentleman walked by and gave us 3 menu. We were ready to order since we looked at the menu posted in the window outside but before we could tell him that, he ran off. About 5 mins later, we witnessed the female server that ignored me earlier walk to every table in front, behind and beside us but completely avoided our table. She did a full circle and pleasantly talked to every other table but ours. At first I thought that she was just making her rounds but nope she never came to the table to even acknowledge us. \\\"Maybe she isn't our server\\\", says my aunt. \\n\\nAbout 5 mins later, the male (I think he is one of the managers) that have us the menus asked if he could get us something to drink. We told him we were ready to order and as we were ordering the female server (Emily) walked by and was going to tell him that she could take it but he was almost finished. Emily brings out our drinks along with some paper napkins and requests that we return to her the cloth napkins and silverware that we were provided when we sat down. She said something about we only need spoons. \\n\\nOk, I'm over this story and getting more annoyed as I sit here still in this place that has AWFUL service so I'm just going to close with this...THIS PLACE SUCKS and Emily needs some customer service training (acknowledge your customers!).

Note that last sentence... this is a BAR folks... nothing irritates me more than folks who go to these joints and then berate the quality of the steak or the fresh fish of the day and give a bad rating.  OK so go that off my chest.  This place is perfectly casual and fun and a great place to pick up a game or just have a low key bite and beers.  It is also home to what is arguably the best bruger in Charlotte - at least that is the designation this place has in our household.  If its not the best burger in town it's TOP THREE.  The pretzel buns and the quality of the meat are great, you can be creative with toppings - within reason - and the round fries are awesome (even though I now do sweet fries just to be healthier).  I even branched out and had the blackened fish tacos a few weeks back and was VERY pleased and will work that into the rotation going forward.  If you see a guy sititng on a stack of beer cases at the end of the Bar, say hello... it's likely the guy who owns the joint and he is good people.  Eat up!</td>\n",
